# Gamerzone

A minimalist, fast, responsive website built with a simple, clean UI with the purpose of sharing hundreds of users' computer game strategies and walkthroughs with millions of others who seek guidance on progressing with their particular game mission or story, or quite simply gain knowledge from experienced players to further improve their own gameplay.

Setup:
- Clone the project
- Create 2 separate bash terminals, one with the client file directory and the other with the server
- Run 'npm i && npm start' for both client and server side to start the app

TODO: refactor reducers, maybe add clickable tags, fix update functionality
